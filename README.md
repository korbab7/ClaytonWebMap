This project is my first web map, titled "Exploring Downtown Clayton, NC". It shows a walkable path through the heart of downtown Clayton, North Carolina and goes through four different locations. The locations are Noe's Bakery, Flowers by the Neuse, Hocutt-Ellington Memorial Library, and Boulevard West. Readers are able to clearly see the path with markers at each location, which provide the name when you hover over them. There is also a sidebar with a description to provide the viewer with context about the map. The map is provided by Leaflet and is the OpenTopoMap option. Data was aquired from Google Maps which was then entered into the Maps to GPX tool mapstogpx.com and convered into GeoJson format using geojson.io.
